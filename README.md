Hallo!
I'm Jacob Hoopes (@JacobHoopes), a Juinor CS Major at Reed College.
I like recursion, state diagrams, and not proofs by reduction.
Currently I'm taking Computer Systems, Computer Networks, Computability and Complexity, and German 220.
Reach me if you're looking to hire $45.00 /hr and up remote work this summer!
